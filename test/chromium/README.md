# Requirements

- Python 2.7
- Selenium
      - Install Selenium as a python package using ```pip install selenium```, or run install-dev-dependencies.sh and it will do the job
- ChromeDriver
      - Run ```apt-get install chromium-chromedriver```, or run install-dev-dependencies.sh
      - Or, manually download ChromeDriver from https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads. Extract the executable to /usr/lib/chromium-browser/, so that the pasted executable's full path becomes /usr/lib/chromium-browser/chromedriver
