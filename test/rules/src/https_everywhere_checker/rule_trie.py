# Rule trie
#
# Rule trie is a suffix tree that resolves which rulesets should apply for a
# given FDQN. FQDN is first transformed from potential IDN form into punycode
# ASCII. Every node in the tree has a list of rulesets that maps the part of
# FQDN between dots to list/set of rulesets.
#
# Children subdomains are mapped using dict.
