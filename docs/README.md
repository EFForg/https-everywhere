# HTTPS Everywhere Documentation

The markdown files contained in this path provide documentation for
contributing to HTTPS Everywhere.  These files are also templates that can be
used to generate the markup for HTTPS Everywhere pages under
`https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere`.  To do so, install the program `pandoc`
and run

    pandoc faq.md

Copy the output, excluding the header on the first line, to the source of the
relevant page within the CMS.  Note that some of the pages are dynamically
generated and are not generated from templates contained here.
