These configs allow you to run an Apache that SSL listens on many local ports
with a different certificate on each. This allows you to start up a Firefox
that loads many different certs and tries to report them to the observatory
simultaneously. This can be helpful for reproducing bugs.

Steps:

1. (optional) Run makeconfig.sh
2. /usr/sbin/apache2 -d . -k start
3. In your development Firefox profile, go to
    Preferences -> Advanced -> View Certificates
    Import -> select certificates/ca.crt
    Check the box for "Trust this CA to identify websites"
    Click OK
    about:config ->
      extensions.https_everywhere._observatory.alt_roots = true
      extensions.https_everywhere._observatory.enabled = true
      extensions.https_everywhere._observatory.use_custom_proxy = true
      extensions.https_everywhere._observatory.server_host = localhost:3001
      extensions.https_everywhere.LogLevel = 0

4. for n in `seq 3001 3100` ; do firefox https://localhost:$n/ ; done
