    <div id=SwitchPlannerDescription>
    Switch Planner mode helps prepare for your site's switch to HTTPS by generating
    a report of external HTTP resources that might not yet be available on HTTPS.
    <p>
    After enabling, navigate around your site and try to exercise all
    functionality in order to get a comprehensive list of external resources.
    <p>
    For each group of resources listed as "Unrewritten," find out whether they
    are available on HTTPS. If so: add a rule to HTTPS Everywhere! If not: try
    to make them available over HTTPS or use a different resource or provider.
    Otherwise your site will generate
    <a id=MixedContentLink href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Security/MixedContent#Mixed_passive.2Fdisplay_content">Mixed Content</a>
    (passive or active) errors when you turn on HTTPS.
    <p>
    For most accurate results, disable ad blockers before using. Closing this
    panel will deactivate Switch Planner mode and clear stored data.
