	Fully covered hosts in *gluster.org:

		- (www.)
        - lists
        - download

    There is still issue with dev.gluster.org (waiting on migration
    to a new host) and issue with the cookie for jenkins (again, waiting
    on cleaning the config on the jenkins side).

    A proper certificate should also be deployed for gluster.org to www
    redirection
