	A few style sheets are hardcoded as http:// and
	considered mixed content in Firefox and friends.
	This does not break the design though.

	Some videos are served on tv.alternativet.dk, which
	serves a bad cert. This breaks any pages on www
	which serve video content.

	Problematic domains:

		- tv ยน

	ยน Bad CN in cert
