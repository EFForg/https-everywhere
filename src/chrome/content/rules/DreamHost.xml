	For other New Dream Network coverage, see New-Dream-Network.xml.


	CDN buckets:

		- securendn.a.ssl.fastly.net


	Nonfunctional domains:

		- blog.dreamhost.com			(self-signed & cert mismatch)
		- links.dreamhost.com			(cert mismatch)
		- objects.dreamhost.com			(cert expired)
		- *.objects.dreamhost.com		(cert expired)
		- whois.dreamhost.com			(refused)
		- whoisweb.dreamhost.com		(refused)
		- wiki.dreamhost.com			(refused)
		- dreamhoststatus.com			(cert mismatch)


	Note: It appears that the dreamhost.com domain has a number of subdomains under
	which third party sites are hosted, such as http://bokane-beta.dreamhost.com/,
	http://crookedtimber1.dreamhost.com/, and http://otismaxwell.dreamhost.com/.
	In addition, it appears that these subdomains for third party sites do not
	necessarily support HTTPS. Given the possibility that the dreamhost.com
	domain may have subdomains for third party hosted sites added or removed over
	time, it is advisable for the DreamHost ruleset to have an explicit list of
	target domains that are redirected to HTTPS instead of a wildcard
	*.dreamhost.com rule combined with exclusions for nonfunctional domains.
