<!--
	For rules causing false/broken MCB, see Canonical-falsemixed.xml.


	Other Canonical rulesets:

		- Launchpad.xml


	Nonfunctional subdomains:

		- (www.)	(dropped)


	Partially covered subdomains:

		- design *

	* Avoiding false/broken MCB, rest covered in Canonical-falsemixed.xml


	Fully covered subdomains:

		- blog.bazaar
		- certification
		- irclogs
		- shop
		- support


	Mixed content:

		- Scripts on design from design *
		- css on design from design *
		- Images on design from design *
		- favicon on design from www.ubuntu.com **

	* Secured by us
	** Unsecurable, doesn't trip MCB


	design is in a separate falsemixed ruleset
	due to scripts and css from design.

	NB: We secure all resources, and thus
	falsemixed should be merged for Ffx 24.
