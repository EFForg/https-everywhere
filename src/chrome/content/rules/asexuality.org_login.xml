	Sept 2017: This ruleset has 2 functions. First, it redirects the non-forum part of the site, located at "/", to HTTPS
	in all browsers. The forum is located at "/en/". Second, it redirects the target URL for the forum's login form to
	HTTPS in all browsers. Due to mixedcontent issues, the rest of the forum can't be redirected to HTTPS except in
	mixedcontent-friendly browsers, which is handled by the other ruleset file.
