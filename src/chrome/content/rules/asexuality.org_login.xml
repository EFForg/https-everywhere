	Sept 2017: This ruleset has 2 functions. First, it redirects the non-forum part of the site, located at "/",
	to HTTPS in all browsers. The forum is located at "/en/". Second, it redirects the target URLs for the forum's
	account registration and login forms to HTTPS in all browsers. Due to mixedcontent issues, the rest of the
	forum can't be redirected to HTTPS except in mixedcontent-friendly browsers, which is handled by the other
	ruleset file.
