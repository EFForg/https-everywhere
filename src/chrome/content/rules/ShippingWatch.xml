Disabled by https-everywhere-checker because:
Fetch error: http://www.shippingwatch.dk/ => https://www.shippingwatch.dk/: (51, "SSL: no alternative certificate subject name matches target host name 'www.shippingwatch.dk'")

  This renders poorly. The style sheet
    http://shippingwatch.dk/template/swVer1-0/css/main.css?rev=35794
  is essential for the layout but is served through http.
