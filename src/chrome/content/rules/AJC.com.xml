	<!-- 
	Rewrite rule must touch https to fix errors caused by the site adding
	https to links that do not support it. When a user requests a page
	on https://www.ajc.com, it often seems to add https to other ajc.com
	links on that page regardless of whether or not the subdomain supports
	https. This can be a problem because clicking on a https://ajc.com link
	results in an invalid cert error. The rule fixes this by rewriting
	https://ajc.com links (which don't support https) to https://www.ajc.com
	links (which do support https).

	Example:
		https://www.ajc.com/news/local/woman-emory-doctors-left-camera-body-after-surgery/Ajt6yMsjByDAWJTLfkDCyM/
		The Most Read sidebar on the above page (or most any other page) is
		an example of behavior that necessitates the rule. https://ajc.com
		links are created despite it not supporting https. Visiting that page
		and clicking on one of the https://ajc.com links on the sidebar
		(while the below rule is disabled) should reproduce the issue.

	<rule from="^https?://ajc\.com/" to="https://www.ajc.com/"/>
	<rule from="^http:" to="https:" />
