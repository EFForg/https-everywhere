 (The following is removed when the extention is built,
 allowing for notes to be viewed by other devs without 
 cluttering up the final ruleset file.)
 
 === About ===
 
 Secures connections to lds.org (and ldscdn.org), the official
 site of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,
 also known as the 'LDS Church' or 'Mormon Church'.
 
 As to the choice of the ruleset name, the Church prefers
 that people refer to them by their actual name and not 
 their nickname(s). This is just for future reference.
 
 Refer to http://newsroom.lds.org/style-guide
 
 === Notes ===
 
 These sites appear okay:
  tech.lds.org
  history.lds.org
  store.lds.org
  institute.lds.org (just need iperceptions ruleset for full encypt)
  seminary.lds.org  (same as above)
  ldsces.org  (will do later, see below)
  
 The following sites redirect to already https supported site:
  feeds.lds.org      	> google feedburner
  broadcast.lds.org  	> to http://lds.org/broadcast
  clerk.lds.org      	> http://lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp...
  scriptures.lds.org 	> lds.org/scriptures
  music.lds.org      	> lds.org/music
  youth.lds.org     	> lds.org/youth
  new.lds.org			> lds.org
  (probably more)
 
 Following ones do not support https:
  classic.lds.org
  lds.org/ldsorg/... This is just the classic.lds.org under a 
    different path. For example, the following fails to load:
    https://lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?locale=0&vgnextoid=22dfd7256ec8b010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD
  jesuschrist.lds.org
 
 Already forces encryption:
  secure.lds.org
  cdol.lds.org
 
 ldscdn that work under https:
  media.ldscdn.org
  edge.ldscdn.org
  ldscdn.org

 ldscdn that did not work:
  media2.ldscdn.org    invalid cert (a248.e.akamai.net)
