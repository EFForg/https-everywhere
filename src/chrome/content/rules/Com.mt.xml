Disabled by https-everywhere-checker because:
Fetch error: http://business.medbank.com.mt/ => https://business.medbank.com.mt/: (28, 'Connection timed out after 10000 milliseconds') This rule was automatically generated based on an HSTS
     preload rule in the Chromium browser.  See
     https://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/net/http/transport_security_state_static.h
     for the list of preloads.  Sites are added to the Chromium HSTS
     preload list on request from their administrators, so HTTPS should
     work properly everywhere on this site.

     Because Chromium and derived browsers automatically force HTTPS for
     every access to this site, this rule applies only to Firefox. -->
