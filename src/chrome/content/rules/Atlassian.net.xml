	For other Atlassian coverage, see Atlassian.xml.


	This rule was automatically generated based on an HSTS
	preload rule in the Chromium browser.  See
	https://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/net/http/transport_security_state_static.h
	for the list of preloads.  Sites are added to the Chromium HSTS
	preload list on request from their administrators, so HTTPS should
	work properly everywhere on this site.

		- bro-tracker
		- ecosystem
		- mariadb
