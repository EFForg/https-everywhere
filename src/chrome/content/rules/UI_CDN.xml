<!-- Do not change -> approved by 1and1 staff -->
<!--
	We (at 1and1) decided to remove this rule since it breaks the following:
	- http sites using the http uicdn will be redirected to the https uicdn which causes cross domain problems

	All our sites are redirected to their https version by the corresponding configurations for https-everywhere.
	The https site knows itself where to fetch its content and the browser blocks mixed-content if it doesn't, so the user is always safe.

	We would recommend leaving it like this, this is also why we left the config without function,
	so that nobody else would try to create a configuration file for our cdn.
