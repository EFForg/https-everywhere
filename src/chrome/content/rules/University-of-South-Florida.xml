	Pretty complete ruleset for the various usf.edu and usfsp.edu domains.
    Note that the usfsm domains are not yet https protected.

	These domains are giving errors in the build. Removing so we can get initial rules working, will follow up.
	<target host="vpn.usfsp.edu" />  SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate
	<target host="lib.usf.edu" />  SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate
	<target host="usfweb2.usf.edu" />  (this uses a very weak cypher) OpenSSL SSL_connect: SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL in connection

	Nonfunctional usf.edu subdomains:

		- directory.acomp	   (cert: netid.usf.edu; redirects there)
