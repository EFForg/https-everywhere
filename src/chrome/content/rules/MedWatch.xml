Disabled by https-everywhere-checker because:
Fetch error: http://www.medwatch.dk/ => https://www.medwatch.dk/: (51, "SSL: no alternative certificate subject name matches target host name 'www.medwatch.dk'")

  This renders poorly. The style sheet
    http://medwatch.dk/template/mwVer1-0/css/main.css?rev=35817
  is essential for the layout but is initially considered mixed content.
