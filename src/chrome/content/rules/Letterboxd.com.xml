	there is also ltrbxd.com which appears to be mainly used for a cdn.
	However not all subdomains work correctly with https. For example,
	every file on a.ltrbxd.com is also available on skyfall.a.ltrbxd.com,
	oblivion.a.ltrbxd.com etc. These servers can be accessed with https
	but browsers will display errors/warnings because there is only a
	wildcard certificate for *.ltrbxd.com and not one for each of the subdomains.
