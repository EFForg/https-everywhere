<!--
	This rule was automatically generated based on an
	HSTS preload rule in the Chromium browser.  See
	https://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/net/base/transport_security_state.cc
	for the list of preloads.  Sites are added to the Chromium
	HSTS preload list on request from their administrators, so
	HTTPS should work properly everywhere on this site.
 
	Because Chromium and derived browsers automatically force HTTPS for
	every access to this site, this rule applies only to Firefox.


	Mismatches:

		- 404.s.sapo.pt	(CN: js.sapo.pt; works)
		- h.s.sl.pt	(ditto)
		- i.s.sl.pt	(ditto)


	Nonfunctional domains:

		- exameinformatica.sapo.pt
