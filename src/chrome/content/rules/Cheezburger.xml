	CDN buckets:

		- wac.1ddb.edgecastcdn.net/??1DDB/

			- images.cheezburger.com


	As of 2012-08-22, known unprotected subdomains are:

		- advertising	(unbounce.com certificate)
		- blog		(not listening on https)
		- corp		(not listening on https)
		- developer	(mashery.com certificate)
		- feedback	(uservoice.com certificate)
		- jobs		(theresumator.com certificate)
		- sites		(unbounce.com certificate)

	However, there are tens (hundreds?) of subdomains supporting https with
	a wildcard certificate, so it's not worth whitelisting them one by one.

	Other related unprotected hosts:

		- chzb.gr
		- knowyourmeme.com


	Problematic domains:

		- images.cheezburger.com	(works; mismatched, CN: gp1.wac.edgecastcdn.net)
