Disabled by https-everywhere-checker because:
Non-2xx HTTP code: http://support.cheezburger.com/ (200) => https://cheezburger.support.com/ (404)

	CDN buckets:

		- wac.1ddb.edgecastcdn.net/??1DDB/

			- images.cheezburger.com (mismatched, CN: *.chzbgr.com)

		- cheezburger.freshdesk.com

	As of 2016-04-05, known unprotected subdomains are:

		- advertising	(unbounce.com certificate)
		- blog		(not listening on https)
		- corp		(not listening on https)
		- feedback	(uservoice.com certificate)
		- jobs		(theresumator.com certificate)
		- sites		(unbounce.com certificate)
		- support	(freshdesk.com certificate)

	However, there are tens (hundreds?) of subdomains supporting https with
	a wildcard certificate, so it's not worth whitelisting them one by one.

	Other related unprotected hosts:

		- knowyourmeme.com


	Problematic domains:

		- images.cheezburger.com	(works; mismatched, CN: gp1.wac.edgecastcdn.net)
		- support.cheezburger.com	(freshdesk)
