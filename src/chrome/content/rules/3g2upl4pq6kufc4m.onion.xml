	This ruleset covers DuckDuckGo Onion service on Tor.
	Note: This should be something like platform=tor, to indicate
	that these rules should not go through the fetch tester on the
	non-Tor Internet because they will fail. As an approximation to
	that, we just use platform="mixedcontent", since Tor Browser is a
	mixedcontent platform, and the https-everywhere-checker will skip
	non-default platforms.
