	May 2016 Note:
	Craigslist only supports https on its .org, .ca, and .co.uk
	domains. geo.craigslist.org redirects to regional sites by sending protocol-
	relative redirects such as "//toronto.craigslist.ca". Unfortunately, it does this
	even when the destination doesn't support https, such as helsinki.craigslist.fi,
	making a downgrade and exclusion necessary.

	April 2017 Note:
	We are not sure if the 2016 note is still true, this needs further testing.
	toronto.craigslist.ca WFM on HTTPS and also https://geo.craigslist.org/iso/fi redirects correctly.
