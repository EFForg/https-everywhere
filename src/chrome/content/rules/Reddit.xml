	Nonfunctional domains:

		- blog.reddit.com	(blogger)
		- buttons.reddit.com	(503, akamai)

		- pixel.redditmedia.com	(dropped)

			Seems some sort of ad tracking, possibly can be sent to /dev/null; didn't find
			anything broken when I blocked the domain.  Doesn't seem to be used anymore.

		- www.redditmedia.com	(refused)

			Seems only/mostly to be used for ads


	No pages are covered, therefore there
	*CANNOT* be any mixed content!
