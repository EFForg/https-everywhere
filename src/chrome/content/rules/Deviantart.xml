<!--
	For problematic rules, see Deviantart-mismatches.xml.


	Other deviantArt rulesets:

		- Sta.sh.xml


	Mixed content:

		- Images, on:

			- shop. ... .com from www.da-files.com ¹
			- *. ... .com from e.deviantart.net ²

	¹ Unsecurable <= 404
	² Secured by us


	Note: A site operator previously asked for this rule to be
	disabled with the rationale of the site's https deployment
	not having been ready at that point.

	We're waiting for:

		- test (elements)
		- More feedback from ( https-e user ∪ da user ) testers
		- Statements from DA webmasters affirming that the site is ready
