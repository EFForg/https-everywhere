<!--
	Other ruleset: QiDian.xml

	Subdomains (acts/book) appearing in this ruleset have 2 main reasons:
	1. They are using non-https CDN overseas
	2. They are dropped by The Great Firewall when foreign visitors try to use https connection.
	Chinese users can manually enable this ruleset.
	
	^(www.)? are not "Only avaiable in China".
	However, all the pages with .aspx are old style, MCB.
  Some of them need to be redirected to book.qidian.com
