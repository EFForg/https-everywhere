	This rule is off by default because it caused so many aspects of the
	Amazon site to break; see the mailing list archives for details.
	Currently being fixed...

	Amazon appears to operate in 7 countries, and does not hold the domains
	for some others, like .se or .be.  In other cases there is an http-only site
	that redirects to one of these 7 countries.

	<!--	Verified as working for UK, ca appears to function identically.

		Unfortunately, navigating to an unsecured page wipes one's shopping basket :(
			This is problem with our handling of secure cookies, wherein we treat
		secure and non-secure cookies with the same ID as one cookie, instead of two.
			If our handling were correct, this securecookie rule would have only
		one problem, namely that basket information would be missing on search pages.
