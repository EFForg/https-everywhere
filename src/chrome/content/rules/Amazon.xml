<!--
	Other Amazon rulesets:

		- Amazon-Associates.xml
		- AmazonAWS.xml


	This rule is off by default because it caused so many aspects of the
	Amazon site to break; see the mailing list archives for details.
	Currently being fixed...

	Amazon appears to operate in 7 countries, and does not hold the domains
	for some others, like .se or .be.  In other cases there is an http-only site
	that redirects to one of these 7 countries.


	amazon.com
		does work:
			ap/		(appears to be purchase-management related)
			([\w\-]+/)?dp/	(i.e., dp/ possibly preceeded by title)
			e/\w{10,10}/	(i.e., e/ followed by ASIN)
			gp/cart
			gp/css
			gp/feature.html
			gp/redirect.html
			gp/registry/wishlist

		doesn't work:
			$		(i.e., homepage)
			([\w\-]+/)?b/ 	(i.e., b/ preceeded by category)
			exec/obidos/ASIN/
			([\w\-]+/)gp/	(i.e., gp/ possibly preceeded by title)
			gp/goldbox($|\?)
			gp/kindle/pc($|\?)
			gp/pdp/profile($|\?)
			gp/product/
			gp/richpub/syltguides/byauthor($|\?)
			Help/
			l/
			s/

	amazon.co.jp:
		does work:
			/ap/
			a few pages under gp/
		doesn't work:
			everything else

	amazon.cn:
		doesn't work:
			everything?

	amazon.*:
		does work:
			everything except...
		doesn't work:
			gp/search\?
			/mn/search/
			s/
			s\?rh=		(i.e., search pages and files)
				

	Partially covered domains:

		- askville.amazon.com	(pages redirect to SendToHttp.do)

	<!--	Verified as working for UK, other sites matched appear to function identically.

			This is problem with out handling of secure cookies, wherein we treat

			If our handling were correct, this securecookie rule would have only
		one problem, namely that basket information would be missing on search pages.
