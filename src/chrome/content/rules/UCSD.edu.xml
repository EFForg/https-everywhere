     TritonLink used to be called StudentLink according to https://sites.google.com/site/ucsdecegsc/information-for-new-students/tips-for-new-students
     This info is several years old and not worth worrying about.

     Known cases of different content between http and https:
     emerald.ucsd.edu

     I haven't yet verified the (non-)existence of www subdomains for all cases.
