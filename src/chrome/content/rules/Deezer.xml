<!--
Disabled because:

Currently Deezer's website *generally* redirects as follows:

	https://deezer.com/      301 Moved Permanantly (to www.deezer.com)
	https://www.deezer.com/  302 Found             (to plain-http URL)
	http://www.deezer.com/   200 OK

That is, if we apply an http -> httpS rule to [www.]deezer.com most paths will
end up being loaded via plain-http anyway.  The one (known) exception is the
path /ajax/gw-light.php which Deezer's servers do not redirect to plain-http.

If we apply the http -> httpS rule for [www.]deezer.com, the top-level document
ends up being redirected to load via plain-http, but then makes non-redirected
httpS XHR POST requests to gw-light.php.  Since it makes these XHR requests
without requesting cross-origin permissions the requests fail.  The main
symptom of this failure is that clicking on the left-hand navigation bar does
nothing.
