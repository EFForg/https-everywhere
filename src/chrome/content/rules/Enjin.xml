<!--
	IMPORTANT INFORMATION:

	Sites, developed by the public, created on the Enjin Network have the ability to force
	HTTP or HTTPS themselves. If they enable HTTPS, the site will automatically force a
	HTTPS connection. You cannot add a rule to force HTTPS for sites that specifically
	request to force the HTTP protocol, doing so will cause a redirect loop
	(between the HTTP and HTTPS protocols) to occur.

	This functionality may be altered in the near future to ensure all sites use HTTPS and proxy
	insecure material (such as scripts, stylesheets and images) through a HTTPS-enabled proxy.
