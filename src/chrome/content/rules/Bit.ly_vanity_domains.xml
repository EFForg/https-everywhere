<!--
  Caution: These domains are mostly owned by a non-bitly company, and
  it appears that the company sometimes reclaims them. This results in
  a very bad problem: We continue to rewrite URLs on foo.co to bit.ly,
  but bit.ly no longer recognizes the name, and so redirects to some
  other page. Most recently this happened with sched.co:
  https://github.com/EFForg/https-everywhere/issues/1339

  Before re-enabling this rule, we need to add special logic to the
  https-everywhere-checker to do nslookups on hosts in this rule and
  verify they still resolve to bit.ly's IP space. Examples:

  (sched.co is no longer pointing at bit.ly)
  $ nslookup sched.co
  Server:         127.0.1.1
  Address:        127.0.1.1#53

  Non-authoritative answer:
  Name:   sched.co
  Address: 45.56.77.32

  (huff.to still points at bit.ly)
  $ nslookup huff.to
  Server:         127.0.1.1
  Address:        127.0.1.1#53

  Non-authoritative answer:
  Name:   huff.to
  Address: 69.58.188.49

  $ nslookup bit.ly
  Server:         127.0.1.1
  Address:        127.0.1.1#53

  Non-authoritative answer:
  Name:   bit.ly
  Address: 69.58.188.39
  Name:   bit.ly
  Address: 69.58.188.40
