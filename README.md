[HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/EFForg/https-everywhere.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/EFForg/https-everywhere)
================

Getting Started
---------------

Get the packages you need and install a git hook to run tests before push:

    bash install-dev-dependencies.sh

Run all the tests:

    bash test.sh

Run the latest code and rulesets in a standalone Firefox profile:

    bash test/firefox.sh --justrun

Run the latest code and rulesets in a standalone profile for a specific version of Firefox:

    FIREFOX=/path/to/firefox bash test/firefox.sh --justrun

Run the latest code and rulesets in a standalone Chromium profile:

    bash test/chromium.sh --justrun

Run the latest code and rulesets in a standalone Tor Browser profile:

    bash test/tor path_to_tor_browser.tar.xz

Build the Firefox extension as a .xpi package:

    bash makexpi.sh

Build the Chromium extension as a .crx package:

    bash makecrx.sh

Both of the build commands store their output under pkg/.

Precommit Testing
-----------------

One can run the available test suites automatically by enabling the precommit
hook provided with:

    ln -s ../../hooks/precommit .git/hooks/pre-commit
