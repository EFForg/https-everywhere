Getting Started
---------------

Get the packages you need and install a git hook to run tests before push:

    bash install-dev-dependencies.sh

Run the ruleset validations and browser tests:

    bash test.sh

Run the latest code and rulesets in a standalone Firefox profile:

    bash test/firefox.sh --justrun

Run the latest code and rulesets in a standalone profile for a specific version of Firefox:

    FIREFOX=/path/to/firefox bash test/firefox.sh --justrun

Run the latest code and rulesets in a standalone Chromium profile:

    bash test/chromium.sh --justrun

Run the latest code and rulesets in a standalone Tor Browser profile:

    bash test/tor-browser.sh path_to_tor_browser.tar.xz

Build the Firefox (.xpi) & Chromium (.crx) extensions:

    bash make.sh

Both of the build commands store their output under pkg/.

Precommit Testing
