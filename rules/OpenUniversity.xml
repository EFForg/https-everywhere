<ruleset name="The Open University (buggy)" default_off="https://www.eff.org/r.5E5">
<!--
        The OU has myriads of domains, most of which do not support https.
        Specifically, it appears that all department and faculty websites
        do not support it.

        However this ruleset does cover the general website, the prospectuses
        (undergraduate, graduate and research), StudentHome, TutorHome,
        OpenLearn/LearningSpace, LabSpace, and the OU Alumni website.

        Notable exceptions: www2.open.ac.uk, www8.open.ac.uk, library.open.ac.uk,
                            voyager.open.ac.uk, discuss2.open.ac.uk, www.open2.net

        Unknown: intranet.open.ac.uk, intranet-gw.open.ac.uk

        This ruleset does not include mail.google.com as that is already covered
        by the GoogleServices ruleset.

<!--	The OU forwards www.openuniversity.ac.uk to www.open.ac.uk,
