<!-- 
This directory contains web site rewriting rules for the
HTTPS Everywhere software, available from
https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere

These rules were contributed to the project by users and aim to
enable routine secure access to as many different web sites as
possible.  They are automatically installed together with the
HTTPS Everywhere software.  The presence of these rules does not
mean that an HTTPS Everywhere user accessed, or intended to
access, any particular web site.

For information about how to create additional HTTPS Everywhere
rewriting rules to add support for new sites, please see
