	<!-- The following rule (including the downgrade to HTTP) handles a situation
	where the user is on the info page for a specific title. (For example, the URL
	https://csul.iii.com/record=b33044008~S0 leads to the info page for the book 
	"Introducing Shakespeare" by Nick Groom.) Selecting the image of the book
	cover causes the view to divide into two frames, such that the lower frame
	contains an image of the book cover and a number of hyperlinks: "Summary,"
	"Cover Image," and "Product Details." From what it appears, these hyperlinks
	will not work unless the rule given below is present (noted on Sept 12, 2012.)
	-->
	<rule from="^https://csul\.iii\.com/(?=search~S0\?/(?:[^/]+/){3}/bibimage(?:$|[^a-zA-Z]))"

	<!-- For other situations, simply redirect to HTTPS (as expected.) -->
	<rule from="^http://csul\.iii\.com/" to="https://csul.iii.com/" />
